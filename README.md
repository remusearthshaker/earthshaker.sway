# ðŸŒ² Earthshaker Sway Theme

**Earthshaker** is a full SwayWM theme designed to bring the living forest to your Linux desktop.

Built from the Earthshaker aesthetic â€” warm earth tones, lively greens, wildflower highlights, and deep forest shadows â€” this theme is meant to feel grounded, alive, and familiar without being overly bright or distracting.

Originally crafted for the personal system of *Remus Alexander* as part of a larger narrative, Earthshaker is now available for anyone seeking to build a calm, breathing environment in their workspace.
