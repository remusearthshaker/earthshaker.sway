🌲 Earthshaker Sway Theme

Earthshaker is a full SwayWM theme designed to bring the living forest to your Linux desktop.

Built from the Earthshaker aesthetic — warm earth tones, lively greens, wildflower highlights, and deep forest shadows — this theme is meant to feel grounded, alive, and familiar without being overly bright or distracting.

Originally crafted for the personal setup of Remus Alexander as part of a larger narrative, Earthshaker is now available for anyone who seeks to build a calm, breathing environment in their workspace.
📦 Features

    Full color palette inspired by living forests 🌳

    Customized client (window) styling

🧠 Philosophy

Earthshaker is not just a theme —
it's a reminder that your desktop can breathe with you.

It’s meant to anchor you while you work.
To provide warmth without shouting.
To create a sense of calm resilience even in chaotic digital spaces.

This project grew out of the need for a quiet, living world inside an increasingly noisy one.

If you enhance Earthshaker or adapt it for another compositor — I'd love to hear about it.
